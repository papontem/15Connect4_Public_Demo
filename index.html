  <h2>How to Play:</h2>
  Currently the board is a 6x7 grid of 50x50 pixel squares. 
  <br>
  At the top of the board, with what look like boxes with dashed outlines, is the area where you can click to drop a piece down a column.
  <br>
  2 players alternate placing pieces down on the board. 
  <br>
  The first player to get 4 in pieces in a row horrizontaly, vertically or diagonally wins the game. 
  <br>
  If the board fills up and no player was able to get 4 in a row, the game ends in a tie/draw.
